Hello World first project on Github

Hi everyone! 

I love color, 3D printing, engineering and solving complex problems with efficient solutions. Designing things that move and can be moved have become a new obsession of mine and I am curious about combining technologies.
My hobbies are 3D printing, coding, sketching ideas out, writing and exercise (to make sure I can do this for a very long time). 
In order to protect my brain with antioxidants I also eat dark chocolate! :D It's scientificaly proven to be good for your brain and heart so I'm all for it. ;P
